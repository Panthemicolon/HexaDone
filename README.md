# HexaDone
HexaDone is a simple task management / "ToDo" tool with a primary focus on simplicity and ease of use.

# Usage
To create a new task, enter your task in the box at the top of the window and press Enter.

## Topics
By default, all created tasks have the __General__ topic.

To specify the topic of a task, the task can be prefixed with `#<NAME_OF_TOPIC>:<Space>`. Only _None Whitespace_ characters are supported for topic names.

Each topic will be assigned a random color upon creation and if a topic already exists, the new task will be added to the existing list of tasks of that topic.

### Examples:
Input   | Task Content | Topic

\#Chrismas: Buy Presents for Mother|Buy Presents for Mother|Chrismas
\#Chrismas:Buy Presents for Dad|\#Chrismas:Buy Presents for Dad|General
